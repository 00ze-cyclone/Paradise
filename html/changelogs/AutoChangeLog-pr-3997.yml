  - tweak: "NT has removed trace amounts of a highly-addictive substance from the \"100% real\" cheese used in cheese-flavored snacks. As a result, incidence rates of crewmembers becoming addicted to Cheesie Honkers should reduce to zero."
  - tweak: "After receiving complaints about crewmembers often being unable to physically function without a back-mounted barrel of coffee, NT has replaced station all sources of coffee on the station, including coffee beans themselves with a largely decaffeinated version. It was funny the first time almost every crewmember aboard the NSS Cyberiad was lugging around their own oil barrel filled with coffee, it wasn't so funny, nor good for productivity the eighteenth."
