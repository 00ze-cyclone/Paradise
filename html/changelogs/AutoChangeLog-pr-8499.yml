  - tweak: "Due to increasing amounts of spaghetti code in the cryptographic sequencer, emagging maintenance drones cripples their table pathfinding and removes their ability to pathfind under people's legs. Also, Nanotrasen has patched its drones to remove the hidden diamond drill module and rewritten its drone control code so that drones that don't call home and verify their programming after a certain amount of time are destroyed automatically."
