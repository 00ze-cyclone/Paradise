changes: 
  - tweak: "Cryostylane and pyrosium reactions now consume 2 of themselves when exposed to oxygen"
  - rscadd: "fires, temperature, and hotspots can heat anything that contains reagents"
  - rscadd: "Having hot/cold chemicals dumped on you or ingesting them will hurt you. Wear a mask or hat to protect from having someone dump the hot/cold things on you."
  - tweak: "Chem Heater temperature adjustment tweaked; can no longer set temperature on empty containers."
  - tweak: "Chem Heater generally heats faster, but cannot be upgraded"
  - tweak: "Chem Heater automatically stops around target temperature"
  - tweak: "Adjusts fire stacks and how they're applied with a few chems. Naplam, Phlogiston, fuel, thermite, and a few others have all received changes. Most direct fire damage removed."
  - rscadd: "Adds phlogiston dust; a safer, cooler burning Phlogiston."
  - tweak: "Water and Firefighting foam will no longer automagically put out mob based fires; they'll reduce fire stacks (when fire stacks hit 0 they put the mob out)"
  - tweak: "cryostylane puts out mobs instantly"
  - tweak: "Heating fuel can set it off. Be careful when heating it now"
  - tweak: "Increased welding fuel tank size from 1000 to 4000 (wall mounted are still 1000)"
  - tweak: "Sorium and Dark matter now actually throw things"
  - tweak: "Thermite now gets applied to turfs. You'll have to heat the turf up to ignite it. Anything that can heat can now ignite thermite on walls"
  - rscadd: "Adds fake hotspots. They don't do anything except set you on fire when you cross into them. Chemistry's pyrotechnics use these, for the most part; anything that causes a fireball that's chemistry related uses these"
  - rscadd: "Sorium and Liquid dark matter now have visual effects"
  - bugfix: "Fixes chem smoke being on the wrong layer."
