  - rscadd: "All MMI variants can now install an \"MMI radio upgrade\" in order to acquire radio capability when outside of any other chassis. It can be installed either directly on the MMI, or through an opened cyborg chassis. This radio can later be removed if desired by using a screwdriver on the MMI."
