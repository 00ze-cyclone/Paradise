changes: 
  - rscadd: "can insert keys into vehicles instead of having to hold them in your hand (alt-click while riding a vehicle to remove the key); lava boat still requires holding the key in your hand"
  - bugfix: "Fixes moving diagonally with vehicles making you super fast"
  - tweak: "Vehicles now factor in the configured human movement delay; this means all vehicles are slower than they previously were"
  - bugfix: "fixes a bug with mobs on vehicles causing incorrect space transitions"
  - tweak: "ATV sprites updated"
  - rscadd: "Slime speed potions can now apply to vehicles, which makes them faster"
