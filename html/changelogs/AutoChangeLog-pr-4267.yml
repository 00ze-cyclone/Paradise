changes: 
  - rscadd: "Added 4 new HUD styles, \"Operative\", \"Plasmafire\", \"Retro\", and \"Slimecore\""
  - rscadd: "You can now view HUD changes in real-time, by going to Preferences (top right tab) > Game Preferences and changing the HUD style (limited to humans)."
  - rscadd: "There are now three HUD styles you can get via the f12 button- Full, which contains all of your buttons, Minimal, which only contains a few essential buttons, and None, which is a completely blank screen."
  - rscdel: "Removed the remaining aiming code due to maintainability issues and incompatibility with HUD styles."
  - tweak: "Mobs with HUD's now use a unique subtype instead of an anti-OOP else-if chain."
  - tweak: "Refactored how objects (IE, stuff you pick up) is rendered to the HUD. This should fix the reoccuring \"stuff on my screen that definately isn't meant to be there\" bug, but keep an eye out for things that do not appear."
