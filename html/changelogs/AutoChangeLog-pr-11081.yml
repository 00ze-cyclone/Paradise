changes: 
  - tweak: "Improved the interface for Syndicate Uplinks. They now clearly mark which items are hijack-only and which are not. If you attempt to purchase a hijack-only item without hijack,  they will explain why you can't."
  - tweak: "Atmos Gas Grenades (the uplink grenade kit) are now split into Knockout grenades (2 N2O grenades, 8 TC, available to all agents), and Plasma Fire grenades (2 plasma fire grenades, 12 TC, only available if you have hijack). This both makes knockout grenades more useful for normal traitors, and also prevents non-hijackers using a plasma fire grenade to cause massive casualties/damage."
  - tweak: "Plasma Grenades and the Syndicate Bomb can no longer show up in surplus crates, or be discounted. This means while you can buy one if you intend to, you're not randomly encouraged to bomb your target."
