changes: 
  - tweak: "Repairing burn damage to robotic limbs now consumes cable in the process. Each length used repairs 3 burn damage, up to 15 damage per click."
  - tweak: "Repairing brute damage to robotic limbs now uses 1 fuel per repair (click). Heal amount unchanged."
  - tweak: "Self-repairing with cables or welders now incurs a 1 second delay between click and heal completion. Being repaired by a friend is still no delay (but requires a friend)."
