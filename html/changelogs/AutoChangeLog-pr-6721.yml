changes: 
  - tweak: "Firelocks forced by AI's, cyborgs at range or admin ghosts will now autoclose if there's still an atmospherics alarm present."
  - tweak: "Regular (non-heavy) firelocks will now properly respond to explosions (100% chance of being destroyed at severity 1 explosions and 50% at severity 2). Heavy firelocks are still only destroyed in severity 1 explosions."
  - tweak: "Added a visible message to forcing airlocks with the Jaws of Life."
