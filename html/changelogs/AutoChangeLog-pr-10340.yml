  - rscadd: "Updated chaplains. They now spawn with their nullrod in their hand, and their soulstone in their locker. They now have the ability to bless other players. The more players they bless, the more likely admins are to answer their prayers. There are no longer any atheist chaplains. The chaplain items that reference atheism have been tweaked accordingly, e.g the atheist fedora is now the binary fedora. A few other items have also been tweaked. Paranormal ERT members now count as holy, like the chaplain, and red/gamma paranormal ERTs get a more powerful version of the nullrod, so they have a reason to use a weapon other than their gun."
