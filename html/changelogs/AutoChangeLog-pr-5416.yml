changes: 
  - tweak: "Refactors markings. Now split into head, body and tail markings."
  - tweak: "Refactors morph again. Changes made while morphing are now reflected instantly on your sprite."
  - tweak: "Darkens Vulpkanin and Tajara for improved colour fidelity. Species base colour changed to compensate. Add 27 to R, G and B values if Vulp, 15 if Taj to keep the same colour on your character."
  - tweak: "Darkens Vulpkanin facial fur patterns for improved colour fidelity. Add 23 to the R, G and B values of your facial hair/head accessory to keep the same colour on your character."
  - tweak: "Darkens Unathi frills and horns. Add 27 to the R, G and B values of your frills and 21 for horns to keep the same colour on your character."
  - tweak: "Vulpkanin tails are now split-rendered. Tails overlap hair when facing north, but are overlapped by hair when facing all other directions. No other differences, only affects the fluffy husky tail."
  - tweak: "The heads of tiger markings have been isolated and can now be coloured independently."
  - tweak: "Hair can now cover facial hair, and glasses are no longer covered by facial hair and head accessories. Means that two-piece Vulpkanin facial fur patterns won't almost entirely cover whatever glasses they're wearing."
  - tweak: "Tajaran head and facial hair have been darkened. Add 28 to the R, G and B values of your Tajara head/facial hair to keep the same colour on your character."
  - tweak: "Vulpkanin head hair and one facial hair style has been darkened. Refer to PR notes for darkening factors."
  - tweak: "The HAS_MARKINGS flag now represents all marking locations. The HAS_location_MARKINGS flags are for specific locations (head, body, tail)."
  - tweak: "Improves the quality of some Vulpkanin/Tajara/Unathi mask sprites."
  - bugfix: "Naked Humans and Skrell will no longer have exposed flesh poking out their wrists when facing east or west. Male Humans now no longer lack a butt pixel when facing east or west."
  - bugfix: "Mutated limbs now render correctly as soon as they're mutated."
  - bugfix: "Mobs will now correctly appear as fat/skinny."
  - bugfix: "Species with TAIL_OVERLAPPED will no longer wag tail at max speed when facing north."
  - bugfix: "Species with TAIL_OVERLAPPED and body accessories won't crash the game when they wag."
  - bugfix: "Tiger Head and Face markings adjusted so they don't look ugly on certain species' ears."
  - bugfix: "Fixes issue where Unathi dorsal stripe didn't render."
  - bugfix: "Tajaran ears are no longer in their hair sprites, but on their actual heads."
  - bugfix: "The adminbus body accessory now overrides the TAIL_OVERLAPPED flag and will now be rendered correctly on a body regardless of species bodyflags."
  - bugfix: "Changing a person's species via CMA will no longer result in a mob with all the same cosmetic attributes as the old species."
  - bugfix: "Dressers now have species fitting checks for undergarments. Drask are now able to wear undershirts and underwear like they were originally meant to."
  - rscadd: "Adds some head markings for Tajara and Vulpkanin."
  - rscadd: "Adds body marking(s) for Tajara, Vulpkanin, Unathi and Drask."
  - rscadd: "Adds tail markings for Vox and Vulpkanin."
  - rscadd: "Adds 5 Tajaran hairstyles."

  - rscadd: "Adds a hairstyle for Humans, Unathi and Vulpkanin."
  - rscadd: "Adds a facial hairstyle for Vulpkanin."
  - rscadd: "Adds secondary hair (head and facial) themes. Skrell can now colour their tentacle cloths independently, the beads in the Tajaran/Hippie braid hairstyles can be coloured and the same with the webbing in Unathi frills. Can be changed at nanomirrors, via morph and CMA."
  - rscadd: "Adds alternate heads. Unathi can now choose a head with a sharp snout. Can be changed via morph and CMA."
  - rscadd: "Helper procs to convert a hex colour into either R, G, or B."
  - rscadd: "Markings, body accessories, head accessories, alt heads and their colours (if they have colours) can now be randomized at the character preferences screen."
  - rscadd: "Adds a system that attempts to fit mobs with alternate heads with appropriate mask sprites. The sprites just need to be suffixed with the alt_head suffix in sprite_accessories.dm."
  - imageadd: "Adds mask sprites tweaked to fit the new Unathi alternate head to go along with the new alt. head mask fitting system."
