changes: 
  - bugfix: "Fixed a bug where the AI could not delete photos it takes."
  - rscadd: "Ported -tg- cameranets. This means that all of our camera based systems are more or less up to date with -tg-; 510 features are missing."
  - rscadd: "An AI with the 'camera lights' mode on will now, instead of the button toggling the closest camera's light, toggle camera lights on/off as the AI moves."
  - rscadd: "It now takes a minimum of 30 deciseconds between attempting to track someone, and locking on. This number is increased by their distance away from the AI eye."
  - tweak: "The camera activate/deactivate proc is now called 'toggle_cam'."
  - tweak: "The 'trackable' proc has been replaced by a more object-oriented 'mob.can_track()' proc."
  - tweak: "The 'networks' section of the security camera console is now above the camera list."
