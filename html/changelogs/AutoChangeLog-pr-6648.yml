  - tweak: "Changed event probabilities, aiming for a more fun late game. In general, events that do very little (e.g: meaty ores, rogue drones) are less likely. Events that will keep people on their toes (e.g: anomalies) are more likely. Events that might cause people to observe rather than joining the round (e.g: Xenos) are less likely."
