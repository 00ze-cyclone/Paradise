  - rscadd: "New cane shotgun assassination shells. These buckshot shells are coated with a mute toxin which will prevent anyone hit either calling for help or screaming in pain."
  - rscdel: "Old cane shotgun assassination darts."
  - tweak: "Cane shotgun now uses its own internal magazine rather than copying the code for the improvised one. It also now starts with an assassination shell preloaded."
