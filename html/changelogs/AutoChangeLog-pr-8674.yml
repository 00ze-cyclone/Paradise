  - rscadd: "Airlocks now have security levels. Secure airlocks cannot be hacked straightaway. Vault doors and highsecurity airlocks have some security by default. You can make an airlock secure by applying metal and plasteel to it while the panel is open"
  - rscadd: "As a slime, you can drag yourself onto a target to feed"
  - rscadd: "Doors, tables and table frames can be destroyed by hitting them. Airlocks can be repaired by a welder on help intent."
  - tweak: "You can butcher with any sharp item on harm intent"
  - tweak: "Grilles are stronger"
  - tweak: "Vault door assemblies cost 8 plasteel up from 6"
  - tweak: "Xenomorphs can open non-locked non-welded airlocks after some time"
  - tweak: "Firelocks can be welded open again, firelock [de]construction uses crowbar instead of welder"
