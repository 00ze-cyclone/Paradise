changes: 
  - rscadd: "Adds the colourblindness gene. It is eye-dependent, and can be transferred from person-to-person with the eye organ."
  - rscadd: "Colourblindness can be detected by the advanced medical scanner just like blindness and short-sightedness."
  - rscadd: "Vulpkanin and Tajara can now choose to be uniquely colourblind in exchange for fantastic darksight. The default option is colour vision but low darksight."
  - rscadd: "Selecting mechanical or mechanically assisted eyes at character creation grants full colour vision, but standard Human darksight. This overrides the colour vision preference."
  - rscadd: "Mechanical(ly assisted) internal organs such as hearts and eyes are now appropriately named, and have appropriate sprites."
  - tweak: "Vulpkanin and Tajara monkey-forms (Wolpins and Farwas) are incurably colourblind but have excellent darksight as they get nearly the same organs as their greater forms."
  - bugfix: "Increases reliability of turning into a monkey."
  - bugfix: "Fixes a bug with changelings lesser-forming, transforming and humanforming into a different identity."
