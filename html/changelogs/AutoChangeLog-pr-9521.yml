changes: 
  - bugfix: "Species damage modifiers now only affect damage, not healing."
  - tweak: "Races that took more damage from certain damage types no longer heal from that damage type faster. For example: Drask no longer heal from burn at double rate; Grey, Vox no longer heal from brute at increased rate (Note: IPC healing with welders/wires is not affected)."
  - tweak: "Kidan no longer heal from brute at a reduced rate."
