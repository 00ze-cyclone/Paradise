  - rscadd: "Updated the Syndicate Strike team's gear and ready room. Syndicate commandos will now be wearing reinforced black elite syndicate hardsuits and pack more ammo and supplies."
  - rscdel: "Syndicate commandos no longer start with all access."
  - bugfix: "Fixed some issues and improved the usability of the SIT and SST shuttle blast doors. They can now be reliably used to lockdown your shuttle from NT would-be intruders, and can be opened from inside and outside."
